Okay, well, first tell me something about Dungeons & Dragons Tell it Nice question Lovely Dungeons & Dragons It's always difficult to explain to people what the game is about It's a game where you actually have to play it once to really understand it Or you have to see people play it once And often there's also the misconception that people think it's a board game But the big difference is that I always describe it as a role-playing game People who don't know anything about Role-playing games Or at least a tabletop role-playing game But if people don't know Dungeons & Dragons, they don't know that term either And I think the best description you have is at the beginning of the Player's Handbook That's the book that explains all the rules for players And it basically says You're playing with a bunch of people at the table One of them is the Dungeon Master And the players play each character in a fantasy world And what they do is The Dungeon Master controls the world He explains the situation in which the characters are And then the players can decide what their character wants to do in such a situation I think the Player's Handbook has a story about Well, the Dungeon Master explains that you're standing in front of a castle It's slowly getting dark And you notice Well, what do you want to do? And one of the players says, I see something special at the castle And the Dungeon Master says Well, you see that there are Gargoyles on the castle I don't know what that is in Dutch And so you have an interaction between players and Dungeon Master In which you're slowly building a story And Yeah And the fun thing about it is I personally think it's one of the fun things It's a The setting in which you do that is a fantasy setting So there's magic There are things that you normally don't have or can't do in the real world And that's all possible there So yeah, you can bring your fantasy to life in a way And that's what players often do They Yeah They They try something that they normally can't do in their character To bring that fantasy to life Okay Clear You were talking about players having their own characters Yeah Can you tell us more about the characters that players can have? How does that work? Yeah, look It's Basically, every player plays one character And At least, that's Yeah, that's also something that people often don't know Dungeons & Dragons is a Continuous game You have sessions Often from 3 to 4 o'clock At least, that's in real time When you tell people that, they're always like Oh, that's long But Time flies by, so to speak And that's why Often you can't finish A whole adventure that those characters go through in a single session So you often have multiple sessions And during those sessions You often play with the same group And everyone has their own character Well, what What actually happens is The moment you start playing D&D Then you have the choice of Either you make a character yourself Or Well, often for new groups A character is chosen for you Or there's another way to keep it a bit simpler But basically you have You can choose yourself which character you want to play Well, it's I already mentioned it in the Player's Handbook It actually has guidelines for How you make that character So there are rules attached to it To keep it a bit balanced That everyone That there's not just one person Who can do a lot of cool things And the rest is Well, no idea Can hardly do anything Yeah, and there are different For a character you have different options Of what you can do And that always consists of Well, two important I would actually like to say Three important things, I would say In 5th edition D&D What most people play now That's the race of your character So, well The background Well, you can be a human You can be an elf You can play a dwarf There are a lot of other races you can play The class That often determines What your character can do So it's for specialization And there are different things You can be a wizard Wizard Or you can be a fighter Fighter And there are other classes And a piece of background That often disappears a bit to the background But I personally think it's an important piece That 5th edition adds Is a piece of background That you also choose from What is kind of Where does my character come from? Which also has a little bit of influence On your game statistics But not a lot But I think it's interesting That you're also dealing with that How did my character get to this point? Those are actually the three things And they also determine The rules for what your character can do And what you can do And in general Everyone has a character sheet It used to be all on paper Nowadays we also have digital tools To make that easier And that's where all the data is actually Noted on that character And as you do more You can also collect stuff Or get more different things That he can do And you actually write that all down On your character sheet What kind of data is on his character sheet? What kind of data? Most important for playing the game I think the different scores Ability scorers, modifiers Sounds a bit complicated But in principle As I said before The game consists of A Dungeon Master describes something The player decides what they want to do And then Dungeon Master tells what happens If they do that But there are certain actions That you can do in the game For example The outcome is not entirely certain And then the Dungeon Master can decide I would like you to roll for that And in general In Dungeons and Dragons We use a 20-sided dice The player rolls a 20-sided dice To determine Whether the outcome is successful But different characters are of course Good at different things And the way in which that is expressed Is actually The figures that write on your character sheet So you keep track of where you are good at And that is divided into six main categories Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Wisdom, Intelligence and Charisma How would you call that category? Those are the Ability Scores And those are At the beginning of the game You divide that up And from there There are more specific things That your character can do Where you get bonuses So that means If you roll the 20-sided dice There is a number added So that means In general Certain characters are better than others And those are mainly things That you would note on your character sheet Because what you learn from your head You're not going to do So yes That is I think Mainly for your character sheet Other things That you would note on your character sheet Are of course The specific things That your character can do Which are often Expressed in more text Look For example We talked about Yes He can cast spells He can do different Magic spells And that Well What a magic spell does Would be typical What you would write on your character sheet Because you Well Not Yes There are all kinds of rules And then Well It's convenient to write that down Okay And are wizards The only ones Who can cast spells? No Certainly not No No There are a lot of classes In D&D Who can cast spells Yes So In principle You have Wizards But also Sorcerers Warlocks Clerics Paladins Actually A lot of classes Can cast spells The difference Is mainly in Which spells Can they cast And Actually In terms of story Where What is the reason That they can cast spells Okay So Which spells You can cast That depends on your class Yes Partly Look Because It is of course You choose a class But it is also That you Of course You can choose your own path So There are certain choices You can make For example One of the choices That For example A wizard can make Is Which spells He wants to learn So You have a choice From a A large list But then You can only Choose a part of it So It is also There are certain choices That you can make Within a class That you Coincidentally Do get spells But I don't know There are Nowadays There are always The number of options That you have To build a character Keeps growing And I can't Always Keep everything But That doesn't have to Because There are exactly Well Books Such as Player's handbooks Are there As a reference material That you can look up What does it do But it all works On the same system So Eventually Yes It is enough If you know the system Then you don't always have to All specific things To know Okay Yes Yes And are there Other actions That a fighter Can undertake That are not a game Yes Sure Yes Well The fighter Is mainly about Interesting things Can do In Turn-based So Everyone gets a turn In contrast To the normal game Where everyone can just Can react freely And things Can do Is that turn-based And there are So Stricter rules For what Is not allowed And in that The fighter As special Things of his class Just special options What he can do in it Well I'm not Super familiar With All specific options The fighter Has at the moment But Can Do Normal characters Can do Or There are options With Other characters Can help So You can Make sure Another character Can attack An extra time Okay Okay You had it About Monsters Where Against Fight Can be Can you Tell more About the monsters Tell more About the monsters Well What a player is Is a monster According To the rules Look Of course If people Have it About monsters Then they think more Well I know Exotic creatures Where Against Fight Must be For example Well This Academic thing A dragon There You could Against Can fight It's a monster In this Specially For the dungeon master So that he Monsters Can find out And can Present To his players And that goes from Very easy Monsters To defeat To very difficult Monsters To defeat For example A dragon Is well Yes We are at the high end Of the Of the scale So to speak You have to Make an effort To defeat A dragon So Yes How do you know That the dragon Is more difficult Uh Look I mean This On the one hand If you open the dungeon master Menu On the one hand It depends on How big the stat block is Because in general More difficult monsters Can do much more things So then you have A much greater description Of what the monster is Okay But What exactly is a stat block? Ah Good Good Good question Well look As I have explained The players have a character sheet And the monsters Have a much smaller overview What we call a stat block Uh For players It often doesn't matter Because players Don't have to look at it For dungeon masters So those who rule the world It does matter Because they are In general Those who Well Must know What a monster can Yes Well So there is a short overview We call it a stat block Yes And Uh To return To the previous question How do you know What is easy Difficult Well In the past They have made sure That there is a number That indicates how difficult A monster is And that is called The challenge rating It goes from Zero to Somewhere in the 30 I think Uh And the Idea of the challenge rating Is That if you take a monster From challenge rating Three Then it should be Suitable For characters Who are also level three Okay Uh But What does it mean If your character is level three Yes So What I said Is that your character can Through the game Do more and more things And One of the most important things Where Your character is moving forward Is Uh The levels What you have in the class So Every character has a class And Uh The things you can do In a class They are limited in the beginning So There are certain things So That spreads slowly And the way it spreads Is that Around So much time So Then the level of a character Goes up It starts at level one We go on to level 20 And as soon as your level goes up Then there are extra things From the class So Then tells Uh The rules of the class tell you What you can do extra Uh Well As I said Characters start at level one And so If they are level three Then a Pulser of Challenge rating three Would be a suitable Enemy To let them fight Okay And is that a suitable enemy For Fighting No Dungeons and Dragons You always play them Actually Look It doesn't have to But In principle You play Dungeons and Dragons In a group Uh According to me The standard rules go From a group size of four Three or five can also Uh And so Means that If you have four characters From level three Then a challenge rating three Would be a good challenge Okay Yes Okay Clearly Clearly But There are also different rules For example You can not just Play a game But it is It depends on How strong they are If that is also the case But it is a kind of genetic A guide Guide Yes Yes Okay Clear And What is the goal of the game How can a player win Lose No Well That's a bit of a look And that's also confusing Is that That there Not like other games That there is really a kind of winning Say Because in the end You are writing a kind of story Uh The story of Dungeons and Dragons Generally speaking Is just Uh The group The players That are Uh Their characters are adventurers And so they go on an adventure In the world Uh Sometimes Then you have A fully Players A fully written Uh Storyline Well That These are issued by Uh Wizards of the Coast The makers of Uh Dungeons and Dragons Uh You can follow them Or there are people Who also write stories Some Dungeons and Dragons Write their own Storyline And in principle The players walk Through that storyline Say Uh And that means That there Well Often A story Is what they want to finish Uh For example There is a big Uh That's what I'm saying Basically The game doesn't have to be finished It also depends on What I say Ultimately It's mainly Telling a story You could say Of course The players The characters That they play Those are adventurers And then you go Another adventure And then you go on Another adventure So Often It means more That Is it more a kind Uh Well There is a big goal What the players Want to achieve What often Put themselves For themselves Sometimes It is a bit influenced By the storyline itself And is there A little bit Thought about it That goal ultimately leads To the bigger goal Uh But In principle You could say That there is always Something to do again And that's why it feels I think For me Also strange To say That you win the game Because there is always Something new To do Because you always Kind of Goes on It's a kind of Uh Yes Certainly Look Uh In principle We talked about Combat So you can fight And yes If you can fight Then you can also say So deadly Get wounded That you die And there are also Special mechanisms For In the In Dungeons and Dragons To ensure that To determine that And yes If your character dies That is In a certain way Lose Uh Because yes But look If For example The whole group Dies Yes Then it's a bit As if you have lost Say Yes Yes Yes And what happens then If the whole group dies Yes That's a bit Dependent on Uh Well You can As a group Determine yourself Look In principle You can say Uh Uh Well Depending on how you Play the game We go on with The same story Or you just quit completely Yes It depends a bit Of How your group is in it Yes Yes Yes Yes And And for how long Do you Then these kinds Of the stories Because you said that a session Does not last for Three Four hours Yes But How many sessions do you have Yes That is Very dependent On how long How is it The coast Well There is A little more A specific Guideline On how many sessions That will be about I think The shortest Maybe around Yes Look There are also very short Things Where you really One Two sessions Are busy But If you just A real story Pack I think That you Easily Ten sessions Are busy So That is Also The campaigns They are issued As As Adventures But also People who themselves That kind of thing Say You often indicate From this campaign Runs from this level To this level So people Begin The characters often start At that level And when they are ready They are at that level And Therefore You can also Another campaign Attached to it Which then again At that level Yes Certainly Yes Okay And that we indicate With The level The players should be With which they start Yes Yes Difficulty level Of course What What Difficult to say Because it is of course Uh In terms of Game difficulty It is not more difficult It is more Your character Must be a certain level Although You do not Be killed at once By the monsters That are in that Then you can More But yes You are also fighting higher monsters So in a sense The fights Uh Equally difficult It is not entirely true Because there are of course More rules to take into account But In a sense Say Uh Uh A level 1 character Fighting against challenge rating 1 Would not Easier Is not easy Per se easier Than a level 5 character Against a challenge rating 5 Okay Okay So Then So actually try Yes That is indeed Yes Yes Yes Yes clearly We talked about it For example A madman Who then Immortals can revive Are those madmen And the immortals Are those examples of monsters Yes Sure Yes So Uh Uh Look The Monster Manual Gives examples Of well All kinds of monsters Uh They are also divided into categories So Immortal People Skeletons Um But also ghosts fall under this Okay And then Yes The The wizard will fall in a kind of category Of um Well, then it is probably a human Or maybe an elf Or something like that So they shall never fall in the category human And that category Also has a certain Uh Meaning For some mechanisms In the game But that's often just relevant At the moment that Your Specific Character Has things there That do something with it Yes For Well For dungeon masters it is sometimes useful If you have something like that Oh I have a witch I don't know which monster Oh I'm looking for a dead dog Look at what's in it Oh So here's one of challenge rating 3 My party is level 3 Ah I'll get it Okay Okay Clear And And How Because the players They play their characters But Uh How do you know what the monsters do? Yes So Uh Okay So dungeon master has control Well What I said The players play their character Dungeon master actually does the rest So the whole Think about what's going on in the world What the monsters do Uh Yes And Look In general Of course That Well Look Uh It's a bit Uh On the one hand The The dungeon master determines it But he also tries a bit To think about what is natural To do for such a monster Well If we have zombies for example He also runs from the first person The best person Who is not immortal And he tries to eat him Yes Yes Yes Okay Clear And Next to the The Next to the characters of the players and monsters Are there any other entities in the world? Uh Yes So So Look A specific Yes I don't know if you call it the category of monsters In principle, according to the rules Everything that is not a player is a monster Uh But we have Uh Uh NPCs Uh Uh That are certainly Those are characters Such as their player characters But then not by a player So By the dungeon master Uh Uh And those are For example Well Suppose That you The players come into a village Yes People of course live there Well Those are typical examples of non-player characters For example there is a Someone who runs a shop Where the players want to buy something Well That is a typical example for an NPC The players talk to Okay Yes And they can also buy things So there is also money in the game There are things in the game Yes Certainly Yes You have to imagine It is a complete world So everything you would be in a normal world Could do You could do that too Yes It depends a bit on what kind of locations there are But yes If there is a shop You can buy things If there is a Yes If there is a I do not know how much A tea house You can go for tea Yes It is not very exciting to go for tea Because in principle Yes It is not something you will do physically It is something you say That you are going to do character So yes If you say A character is going to drink tea Then you just say Ah A character is going to drink tea That's it So often it is a bit more interesting For example To do something Such as fighting Or Because then you get a little more action Okay Okay Clear Clear Um I'm trying to come up with more questions Those before we talked about Um You were talking about That Dungeons & Dragons In a fantasy setting Yes Is that really only in a fantasy setting? And is that a kind of medieval fantasy? Or is that high fantasy? Yes It is It is Originally Look It is of course based on Um Things like Lord of the Rings So yes That is often the comparison material For people Look It is more based on Than Lord of the Rings But Lord of the Rings Of course A bit of the big famous fantasy-like Setting So that is In general The setting you play in But The world you play in Yes That is Uh In principle Per story And that can be different A Dungeon Master can determine What kind of world that is So the most generic setting So a bit of medieval fantasy Like Lord of the Rings But There are also Uh Different settings Where it is a bit different So you have Uh Uh Eberron is a setting And Eberron is mainly about Suppose What now If we Uh Develop technology Then we have The basis of magic That is practically The setting of Eberron So that is a bit more Technologically advanced But then technologically Based on magic So that's more sci-fi Yes It's more sci-fi So there you have For example A train But that's not a train That drives on electricity But it's a train That drives on magic Okay Yes Yes Yes And there are For example Uh I think A setting book So Uh The Uh Uh Uh Settings Yeah Okay, yeah Dungeon Master Manual That's basically all kinds of tips and tricks for those who want to play Dungeon Master Uh I don't use it much, by the way, but Hahaha It's here It exists Uh, and then there are still, uh, well, books that can indeed explain a whole setting Books that can explain a whole campaign Uh, and there are also books that offer extra options So, well, the basic rules are in those first three books Dungeon Ma- Uh, Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, Dungeon Master Guide Uh, described But yes, there are of course also editions that can do new things, that can be added And that is often published in separate books With new options for players, new options for Dungeon Masters, new monsters Uh And it's always a bit dependent on, uh, yeah, what, what, where, where the focus is, so to speak, of, uh I think with 5th Edition D&D they mainly focus on the release of new settings And then the monsters and player options are linked to that, and things like that Uh, instead of really expanding on what the player options are That the previous editions of Dungeons & Dragons did that a lot Okay, yes There are a lot of books to, well, give players a lot of options But you were talking about the previous editions of Dungeons & Dragons Are there many editions of Dungeons & Dragons? Yes, we are currently on edition 5 But the count is maybe a bit strange Uh, I don't know exactly how the count goes Because there is, I think, you have a 1, you have Dungeons & Dragons Because if you have the first one, of course you're not going to number it And then you have, I think, Advanced Edition And then you have 2 And, but I think, yes, I don't know exactly There is a 3rd edition Uh, there is a 35 edition Because then they were not satisfied with 3, so they did a half edition So a 4th edition And at the moment we are on 5 And the 6th edition is in the making Uh, so yes, it's a bit through the years, uh, well I think it's mainly because they still want to make money from it So it always works well if you release a new edition And everyone has to buy a new edition Because, as I say, it's kind of like, you practically only need 3 books to be able to play Or actually only one Because the Player's Handbook is already sufficient for many things Uh, so the moment the players have that, they don't have to buy anything anymore So if you release a new edition, they will buy some more Yes, yes, yes, yes But okay You mentioned earlier that players have levels and that they can also level up Yes When would you level up? How do we decide that? Yes, that's right Uh, well, look, there are actually two mechanisms to do that Uh, the first mechanism, and that's the classic mechanism we use, is based on experience Well, you probably know that from the random other game that has levels If you have enough experience, you go to the next level Uh, and basically in Dungeons & Dragons you earn experience by defeating monsters Okay So at the moment, every monster has an XP value in addition to a challenge rating Uh, which indicates how much experience a player gets the moment he defeats such a monster Uh, by the way, they are also useful to determine how strong a monster is Uh, but in general, what I notice is that a lot of DMs also choose to instead of giving out experience in that way, they just uh, they call it milestone uh, level up And that just means that a DM chooses a certain moment in the storyline that it makes sense for the player to go to the next level Okay, okay, clear And, um, are there then How would you choose between XP leveling and milestone leveling? Yes, so that is, uh, in principle, that is a choice for the group, so to speak Often the DM makes that choice, so to speak, in the sense of what is easier Look, my personal experience is that, uh, sharing experience is always a bit more difficult because it is just more unpredictable Uh, and then you just don't know what, uh Yeah, you don't know exactly when the players level up And sometimes that happens at a bad time and stuff like that So I personally am a fan of milestone And then you are also guaranteed that after that milestone, that there is a certain level And you don't do that with XP, because if they run away from a monster, they get XP or something, and then they suddenly come to the next fight and then they are no longer strong enough Yeah, yeah, yeah, clearly, clearly Well, are there solutions for that? Because there are also DMs who, for example, share experience based on, uh, other things than monster slaying Uh, and in that way, they actually do milestones, but then kind of break up the milestone into smaller milestones and then share experience per smaller milestone, so that you are guaranteed that you are at a certain level But then the players get the idea that they are gaining experience That's actually a kind of combination between experience and milestones Look, experience is great for players because they then have more frequent moments of, hey, we're moving forward Yeah, but it's often a bit of an extra task for the dungeon master because it's just a bit more difficult to manage to, uh, well, get players to a certain level Okay, clear Um, I think I'm through with my questions Do you have anything else you'd like to tell us about the game that we haven't touched on yet? Uh, yeah, I'm thinking about it Well, we've dealt with a lot of things, of course Yeah, look, it's always one thing, I said that at the beginning The difficult thing about Dungeons & Dragons is just that for people who have never played it, it's just a kind of, uh, look, you can tell all this, but then you're always looking at it What is it? Because it really is something You have to have done it once to really understand how it works, so to speak And especially the piece, which is actually a generic tabletop role-playing game, the piece is, um, Dungeons & Dragons tells something, players decide what they want to do Dungeons & Dragons tells what happens That interaction is quite unnatural if you've never done anything like that before And that's really something Well, I mainly learned it through Dungeons & Dragons, but there are many more games where you can learn through it But I think that's also one of the hearts of what makes the game fun Is that it's just that option and that you also have choices Because one of the nice things about Dungeons & Dragons compared to a classic computer game is often you have a computer game, you have choices, but then you have a choice minute But in Dungeons & Dragons, yes, it's a world You can do what you want If you can imagine that, well, this would be somewhat logical and my character could do it Then you ask the Dungeon Master if you can do it And nine out of ten times you can do it And then something happens And because the Dungeon Master is a person and can react live Yes, there are unlimited options in what can happen And that makes the game a lot of fun Yes, so while with standard video games your choices are limited Yes, and with Dungeons & Dragons it is actually almost unlimited It is only limited to your own creativity and the Dungeon Master Sure, sure Yes, sure Yes, okay, clear Yes Well, then I would say let's wrap up the interview here Yes Oh
