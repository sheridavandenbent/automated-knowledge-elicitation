# Competency Questions

This folder contains the **competency questions** used to evaluate the coverage and structure of the ontologies developed during the thesis *Automated Knowledge Elicitation*. Each question is organized by topic and is accompanied by:

- A SPARQL query file (`Qx.rq`) that formalizes the question
- A CSV file (`Qx_results.csv`) that contains the result of executing the query on the appropriate ontology

These questions were designed to reflect typical queries a user might want to answer using the ontology, and to validate that relevant knowledge is correctly represented.
