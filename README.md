# Automated Knowledge Elicitation

This repository contains the data and outputs from the thesis **Automated Knowledge Elicitation**, written by **Sherida van den Bent** as part of the Master's program in Artificial Intelligence at **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

This research explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) â€” specifically ChatGPT â€” for the process of Knowledge Elicitation, comparing AI-led pipelines to traditional human expert interviews. The goal is to evaluate whether LLMs can support or even replace human experts in gathering domain knowledge and generating ontologies.

The study includes a comparison of different pipeline configurations (human-only, AI-only, hybrid), with evaluation metrics based on both structural analysis and OQuaRE ontology quality metrics.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- `interviews/` â€“ Transcripts of all interviews conducted (with human experts and ChatGPT)
- `ontologies/` â€“ RDF ontologies created from interview data, following different pipeline combinations
- `oquare-statistics.csv` â€“ OQuaRE evaluation results for each generated ontology

Feel free to explore the materials or use them as a basis for your own experiments in ontology generation and AI-assisted knowledge engineering.
